Software Quick Start

Installation and setup
============================
0. Don't connect MiiCraft 3D Printer to the PC yet.

1. Unzip MiiCraftSetupV03.zip to a temporary directory, eg. c:\temp\

2. Unzip your machine dependent CorrectRGB_MASK.png from XXX.zip (XXX is the serial number of the 
   MiiCraft 3D Printer) to c:\temp\Sources\

3. Install the Video-Over-USb Driver by executing c:\temp\Sources\TriggerDriver\12.01.0411.0179.exe.
   After the program finishes, CONNECT the MiiCraft 3D Printer to the PC now. Follow the instructions to
   complete the driver installation. 

4. Windows will detect an Arduino device, navigate to c:\temp\Sources\Arduino drivers\ for drivers.
   The driver will emulate a virtual COM port which is used to communicate to the MiiCraft 3D Printer. 

5. MiiCraftSuite is based on Python 2.6 and above, but is not compatible with Python 3.x. Python 2.6 
   and Python 2.7 are tested and recommended.
   If you have no Python installed, Install Python by executing c:\temp \python-2.6.6.msi
   
6. Run c:\temp\setup_V01.py by double-click on the file, or by executing¡§python setup_V01.py¡¨ in
   the command line mode.

7. Press "Enter" during all the installation process. If some components are installed already.
   press "n" and "then "Enter" to skip that component. 
   
8. Setup.py will place MiiCraftSuit in c:\MiiCraft_V05.

[VERY IMPORTANT]
9. MiiCarft uses USB external monitor to display the sliced patterns. To disply correctly, 
   go to C:\MiiCraft and modify the value of USBDisplayStartX in MiiCraftSuite.ini. 

   The value of USBDisplayStartX = (the primary monitor horizontal resolution) - 1

   For example, my HP 8440p primary monitor is 1366x768, so in my ini USBDisplayStartX is set as 1365.
   If your primary screen is 1920x1080, set USBDisplayStartX as 1919 in your MiiCraftSuite.ini.

10. Because the 3D Printering would take long time to print 3D objects, cancel the 
    sleeping and screen saver functions of Windows.

11. Recommend to change the Windows Wallpaper to blank (black).

3D Print a sample
=============================
1. Double-click c:\MiiCraft\MiiCraftPrinter_V03.py

2. Menu Connect-> Auto Search and Connect to connect to the 3D Printer

3. Menu File-> Open Image Index File, then browse c:\MiiCraft\sample\Hexball\Hexball.idx

4. Click on "Initialize" button, the stage will move up to the HOME position.

5. When the stage reaches the HOME position, click "Print" button to start printing.
